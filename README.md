# SQLarchitecture
Contains the SQL code for designing a casino data architecture

This report summarises the “Casino” data model. In the following, we first provide a fundamental description of the data model across the four main sections it consists of. We then proceed to answer the four questions that came with the “Casino” case, plus an additional question we formulated ourselves, by showing the relevant SQL statements as well as the output the model yields for our fictional data. Finally, the annex will contain the DDL and DML.
